# ORACLE — Kinetic Intelligence Sculpture

> *A physical object that is genuinely alive with intelligence.*

ORACLE is the Prizma Works logo — machined from aluminum, finished in Cerakote, etched with fiber laser, and illuminated from within — traveling through every discipline until it exists in three simultaneous forms: **a physical object, a build film, and a perfect Blender render.**

## The Transformation Pipeline

```
Sketch → Scan → Vectorize → Design → Machine → Engrave → Paint (Cerakote)
→ Finish → Electronics → Firmware → Cloud Brain → Photograph → Video
→ Edit → Animate → Render
```

Each stage is a transformation. Each stage is documented. The contrast at the end between the real object and the ideal render is the thesis statement of what Prizma Works *is* — a studio at the intersection of physical and digital.

## The Full Pipeline

| Phase | Discipline | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| 🎨 Concept | AI-assisted sketching & mood boards | Pencil, Image Generation |
| 🔬 Research | Precedent analysis, component sourcing | Perplexity, NotebookLM |
| 📐 3D Design | Modeling & engineering | Blender, CAD/CAM |
| 🔩 Fabrication | CNC milling, laser etching, Cerakote, SLA printing | Prizma Works |
| 💡 Electronics | LED control, sensors, microcontroller firmware | ESP32/RPi, custom code |
| ☁️ Cloud Brain | Real-time intelligence, Mission Control integration | Firebase, GCP |
| 🌐 Companion Web | Interactive web presence | React, Firebase Hosting |
| 🎬 Documentation | Build film, renders, photography | Blender, Premiere, Prizma Studio |
| 🖊️ Portrait | Photorealistic graphite drawing of the finished piece | Allia Portraits |

## Intelligence System

ORACLE is built with **layered intelligence** — each layer is a self-contained module, added without touching the core:

| Version | Layer | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **V1** | Time of Day | Circadian rhythm — color, brightness, motion shift with sunrise/sunset |
| V2 | Agent Fleet | Mission Control data — active agents, task load, credit burn |
| V3 | Live Research | Perplexity feed — reacts to research relevant to active projects |
| V4 | Presence / Voice | Responds to entering the room, speaking to it |
| V5 | Weather / Ambient | Local conditions feed into behavior |

**Mission Control** (the existing Antigravity dashboard) is the software brain. ORACLE is its physical output device, sharing the same Firebase real-time data layer.

## Status

🟡 **Phase 0 — Concept** *(active — awaiting logo reference files)*

See [`docs/scope-locked.md`](docs/scope-locked.md) for the full locked scope.

*The logo starts as an idea. It ends as three things at once.*
*Built in Cedar City, Utah. Powered by the cloud. Alive in the real world.*
