# ORACLE — Kinetic Intelligence Sculpture

> *A physical object that is genuinely alive with intelligence.*

ORACLE is a tabletop kinetic sculpture that bridges the physical and digital worlds. Precision-machined at Prizma Works, animated by a cloud AI brain, and documented as a complete end-to-end creative build — from first sketch to final film.

---

## The Vision

ORACLE is not a screen. It is not a gadget. It is an **object** — machined from aluminum, finished in Cerakote, etched with fiber laser, and illuminated from within — that responds to the real world in real time.

It knows things. It watches things. And it shows you what it sees through light, motion, and sound.
