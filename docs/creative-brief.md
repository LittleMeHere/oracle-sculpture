# ORACLE — Creative Brief
*Locked: February 18, 2026*

## What This Is

ORACLE is a **brand statement** for Prizma Works — a tabletop kinetic sculpture built around the Prizma Works logo, documented as a complete end-to-end build film, and rendered in Blender as an animated brand asset. It is the most complete demonstration of everything the studio can do, expressed in a single object.

## The Logo's Meaning (Now Locked)

The Prizma Works logo is a **prism philosophy**:

- **Input side** (ruler/measurement marks): Precision, care, expertise, detail — what goes *into* every project
- **The prism** (triangular form): The Prizma Works process — the transformation
- **Output side** (ray burst): The refracted masterpieces — many gorgeous outcomes from one precise input

The sculpture doesn't just *feature* the logo. It *is* the logo, made physical. Precision goes in. Beauty comes out.

## The Physical Sculpture

| Attribute | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Scale** | Tabletop, 30–50cm |
| **Subject** | Prizma Works logo geometry |
| **Form** | TBD — flat surface with etched logo, or full 3D triangular prism solid, or hybrid. Form factor to be explored in concept phase. |
| **Materials** | Aluminum (primary), Prizma Teal Cerakote accent, fiber laser etching |
| **Finish** | Real material texture mixed with Prizma Teal — not monochrome, not fully colored. The contrast *is* the aesthetic. |
| **Illumination** | Internal/edge LED — the ray burst element illuminated from within |
| **Power** | Battery-powered (for photography, display, portability) |
| **Intelligence** | V1: Time of day (circadian rhythm — color temp, brightness, motion speed) |
| **Software Brain** | Mission Control (Firebase real-time data layer) |

### Form Factor Options to Explore in Concept Phase
1. **Flat relief** — logo machined as a high-relief panel, ray burst as individual machined fins
2. **Full 3D prism** — literal triangular prism solid, logo elements on faces
3. **Hybrid** — prism base with flat logo panel mounted/integrated
4. **Kinetic element** — the ray fins rotate (like a fan/iris), driven by time-of-day data

## The Film / Reel

### Purpose
Document the entire build process. Use every skill available: machining, photography, videography, editing, scoring, rendering. The footage is the asset — cut it multiple ways.

### The Three Cuts

| Format | Length | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **The Spark** | ~10 seconds | Social teaser, story, loop |
| **The Reel** | 60–90 seconds | Instagram/TikTok/YouTube Shorts brand reel |
| **The Film** | 3–5 minutes | YouTube long-form, portfolio piece, possibly narrated |

### The Transformation Pipeline (Every Stage is a Shot)
```
Sketch → Scan → Vectorize → Design → Machine → Engrave → Cerakote
→ Finish → Electronics → Firmware → Cloud → Photograph → Edit → Animate → Render
```

### Tone
- Cinematic. Quiet. Precise.
- The sound of a CNC machine is music. (Literally — original score by the creator.)
- No fog. No flying logos through space. Grounded in the real object.

### Music / Score
Original composition by the creator. The score is part of the brand statement.

## The Blender Animation

### The Concept
Instead of a generic logo animation (flying through fog, lens flares, the usual), ORACLE's animation is **grounded in the real object**:

1. **Precision goes in** — the input side of the prism animates: the measurement marks, the precision, the care. BTS clips play *inside* the prism as it's being built — designing, machining, engraving.

2. **The transformation** — the prism processes. The real material texture of the finished object is visible. This is the actual thing, not a CGI approximation.

3. **Light refracts out** — the ray burst animates outward. Each beam is a **spotlight** that lands on a finished product from the shop — each beam = one category of what Prizma Works makes. CNC part. Laser-etched piece. Cerakoted component. 3D print. Each beam, one masterpiece.

4. **The contrast moment** — the physical sculpture and the Blender render exist side-by-side. Real vs. ideal. Neither is "better." That tension is the whole point.

### Why This Works
Every other brand animation shows a logo flying through abstract space. This one shows the logo *doing what it means*. The prism actually refracts. The beams actually land on real things. It's not a metaphor — it's a demonstration.

## What "Done" Looks Like

When ORACLE is complete, these things exist simultaneously:

1. ✅ A physical machined object sitting on a desk, alive with intelligence, beautiful
2. ✅ A 10-second teaser that stops thumbs on social media
3. ✅ A 60–90 second brand reel that tells the full story
4. ✅ A 3–5 minute film that documents the entire build
5. ✅ A Blender animation where the prism actually does what the logo promises
6. ✅ A graphite portrait of the finished piece by Allia Portraits
7. ✅ Open-source firmware on GitHub
8. ✅ A companion website

**The feeling:** Proud. Accomplished. Inspired. Beautiful. Useful. Not perfect — *real*.

## What's Next

1. **Concept art** — generate 6–8 renders exploring form factor options
2. **Precedent research** — Perplexity search for kinetic sculptures, machined art objects
3. **Electronics spec** — lock the MCU, sensor suite, LED type
4. **Fabrication brief** — write the Prizma Works machining brief
5. **Blender storyboard** — rough out the animation sequence

*Precision goes in. Beauty comes out. That's ORACLE. That's Prizma Works.*
