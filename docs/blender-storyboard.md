# ORACLE — Blender Animation Storyboard
*Phase 0 Planning — February 19, 2026*

---

## Concept Overview

The ORACLE Blender animation is the antithesis of every generic logo animation.

Instead of flying a logo through fog and lens flares, we **ground it in reality**: the prism is real, it was machined by real hands, and when the light refracts out the other side, it lands on *real things* the shop made. Every beam is a proof.

## Sequence Breakdown

### ACT 1 — PRECISION IN (~0:00–0:20)

**Shot 1.1 — The Dark**
*Duration: 2s*
Black screen. Silence. Then — the faint sound of a pencil on paper.

**Shot 1.2 — The Sketch**
*Duration: 3s*
A hand draws the Prizma Works triangle on paper. The lines are precise. Deliberate.
*Cut to:* The same shape appearing in Illustrator on screen.

**Shot 1.3 — The Measurement Marks Animate**
*Duration: 4s*
The ruler/measurement marks on the left side of the prism draw themselves in, one tick at a time. Left to right. Crisp. Mathematical.
*Camera slowly pushes in toward the left face of the prism.*
The sound: a single, perfect tone. Like a tuning fork.

**Shot 1.4 — The Input Beam**
*Duration: 4s*
A beam of white light enters the left face of the prism from the upper left.
Inside the prism: *reality*. BTS footage clips play inside the triangular form — hands at the CNC machine, a tool path on screen, chips flying, the laser head moving. Brief, 1-second clips. Fast. Like memory.
*The light travels through the prism. The material texture of the real machined aluminum is visible on every surface.*

**Shot 1.5 — The Material Moment**
*Duration: 3s*
Close up on the machined aluminum surface. Brush marks from the CNC. Tool paths visible as texture.
*The teal accent catches the light.*

### ACT 2 — THE TRANSFORMATION (~0:20–0:35)

**Shot 2.1 — Inside the Prism**
*Duration: 5s*
Camera is *inside* the prism looking out. The light is refracting. The walls are real aluminum — the Blender material matches the actual photographed texture of the finished piece.
*The measurement marks on the left face are visible from inside.*
*The ray fins on the right face are beginning to glow.*

**Shot 2.2 — The Fan Opens**
*Duration: 5s*
The ray fins on the output side begin to slowly rotate open — like an iris. One by one. 
*Slow. Deliberate. Like the CNC machine: precise, inevitable.*
Teal light bleeds through each gap as each fin opens.

---

### ACT 3 — MASTERPIECES OUT (~0:35–1:00)

**Shot 3.1 — The Refraction**
*Duration: 4s*
The ray burst fires. 7 distinct beams of light refract out of the prism into space.
Each beam is a different hue of teal/white — a spectrum.
*The beams arc outward into dark space.*

**Shot 3.2 — Beam 1 Lands**
*Duration: 2s*
Beam 1 hits. A CNC-machined aluminum part appears in its spotlight — turning slowly. Machined to perfection. Camera push-in.
*Sound: the clean ring of aluminum.*

**Shot 3.3 — Beam 2 Lands**
*Duration: 2s*
Beam 2. A laser-etched panel. The engraving detail catches the light.

**Shot 3.4 — Beam 3 Lands**
*Duration: 2s*
Beam 3. A Cerakote-finished component. The teal Cerakote glows under the beam.

**Shot 3.5 — Beam 4 Lands**
*Duration: 2s*
Beam 4. A 3D printed part — the layer lines visible, intentional, beautiful.

**Shot 3.6 — Beams 5-7 Land (Rapid)**
*Duration: 3s*
The last three beams hit fast. Three more products. Three more spotlights.
The space is now full of lit, rotating finished works.

**Shot 3.7 — Wide Pull**
*Duration: 3s*
Camera pulls back wide. The prism at center. Seven spotlights around it. All the finished works glowing.
*Silence for a beat.*

---

### ACT 4 — THE CONTRAST MOMENT (~1:00–1:15)

**Shot 4.1 — Split Screen**
*Duration: 8s*
Screen splits — left half: the Blender render.  Right half: the actual photographed physical sculpture, same angle.
They are almost identical. Almost.
*The render is perfect. The real one has a tiny scratch on the base, a tool mark on one fin.*

**Shot 4.2 — The Statement**
*Duration: 4s*
Text fades in, quiet:

> *"Precision goes in. Beauty comes out."*

**Shot 4.3 — Logo Hold**
*Duration: 3s*
The Prizma Works logo. Still. Glowing faintly.
Fade to black.

## Technical Notes

### Materials in Blender
- Use photogrammetry or hand-painted PBR textures from the actual machined surfaces
- Match the Gun Metal Grey Cerakote exactly (HSL from color sample)
- Aztec Teal (#00B5AD or measured from Cerakote sample) with slight metallic flake
- The Bright Nickel base should have a near-mirror reflectivity

### Camera
- Anamorphic lens look (slight oval bokeh)
- Slow, deliberate moves — push-ins and pulls only, no handheld shake
- The one moment of speed: when the beams refract out

### Lighting
- Primary: one dramatic key light from upper left (matches the logo's "input" side)
- Fill: subtle teal fill from the right (matches the "output" side)
- No ambient — deep blacks throughout

### Render
- 4K minimum
- Motion blur on the rotating fins
- Caustics on if rendering time allows — the light actually refracting is the whole point

## Three Cuts Derived from This Sequence

| Cut | Uses |
|---|---|
| **10s Spark** | Shot 2.2 (fans opening) + Shot 3.1 (refraction burst) + logo hold |
| **90s Reel** | All Acts, faster pacing, score-driven, no text except logo end |
| **3-5min Film** | Full sequence + real BTS footage cuts woven in + narration option |

*The logo doesn't fly through space. It does what it means.*
